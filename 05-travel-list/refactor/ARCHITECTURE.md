# Refactored Travel List – Architecture Notes

## Goals
- Preserve original user experience while adopting 2025 React best practices.
- Remove prop drilling by colocating state logic inside a dedicated context provider.
- Embrace declarative data derivation via hooks so components stay lean and testable.

## Key Modules
- `context/PackingListContext.jsx`: wraps the app, exposes `items` plus CRUD actions sourced from a `useReducer` store.
- `components/ItemForm.jsx`: controlled form that creates new packing entries through the context API.
- `components/ItemList.jsx`: renders a sorted list using the `useSortedItems` hook and offers destructive actions with confirmation.
- `components/Stats.jsx`: relies on `usePackingStats` to compute totals without maintaining duplicate state.
- `hooks/useSortedItems.js` & `hooks/usePackingStats.js`: encapsulate derivations with memoization to avoid unnecessary recalculations.
- `utils/createPackingItem.js`: single factory for producing item objects (centralises id generation and defaults).

## Data Flow
```
<PackingListProvider>
  App
   ├─ Header
   ├─ ItemForm  -- addItem() --> context reducer
   ├─ ItemList  -- toggle/delete/clear --> context reducer
   │    └─ ItemRow (memoised)
   └─ Stats     -- reads items --> derived metrics
</PackingListProvider>
```

## Enhancements Over Original
- **Context + Reducer**: Future components can consume packing data without threading props through intermediate layers.
- **Memoised Selectors**: Sorting and statistics rely on `useMemo`, aiding performance on larger datasets.
- **Accessibility**: Inputs include `aria-label` and consistent button types; the clear button disables when there is nothing to remove.
- **Utility Factory**: All new items are created via `createPackingItem`, centralising defaults and id strategy.
- **Modern Tooling**: Additional scripts encourage linting and type checking workflows expected in contemporary teams.

## Guardrails
- `usePackingList` throws if the provider is missing, catching integration issues early.
- `ItemList` reuses the original confirmation prompt to avoid accidental destructive actions.
- Reducer defaults throw on unknown actions, preventing silent state corruption.

This structure keeps the app easy to evolve (e.g., persisting items, adding categories, or building analytics dashboards) while maintaining feature parity with the `final` solution.
